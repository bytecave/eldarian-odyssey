SPECIAL THANKS -------------------------------------
In memoriam, Brent Stephens, my high school electronics teacher who brought a TRS-80 into the class room one fall day and changed the course of my life and career forever.

Many thanks also to the members of forums.purebasic.com, the PureBASIC forums. It's an active community with a ton of content that was perfect for helping me learn PureBASIC syntax and operation.
