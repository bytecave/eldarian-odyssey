ONENTRY
*****************************************
IF don't have ward or if torch off
 Die immediately on entry  ***DEAD***
 Mention ward and need for light
ELSE

A darkened, wizened lich glides toward you. "Who dare disturb Queen D'rella?!"

If have dagger
  Your dagger explodes into brilliant white and vibrates fiercely; you almost drop it! The lich pauses, then continues. "I fear not thy weapon, foolish adventurer."

If have Eldred's everlasting light
  The undead wizard shies away from the light of your torch. "The Lightbringer's bane! Most interesting." In a moment, light springs from your torch and becomes a part of the room, filling the space. Your torch flutters out, but the light remains.
  
If have scepter
  "A scepter worthy of a prince. Thou hast met mine dragonling!"
  
TALK
**********************************
If first talk
  If not have all 3
    fAboutToDie = #True

  endif

  "Take thy leave, runt. My patience runs thin."

FIGHT
*******************************************
If have all 3 items
  Lich dies (add lich #STATE7 and move to #ITEMGONE)
  #STATE7 Lich - lich dead so secret door can be found and opened
  #STATE3 dagger removed, no more dagger hum
else
  fAboutToDie = #True
endif
  
If fAboutToDie
  D'rella screams, "you have come unprepared, now die!" Shocking streaks of blue and velvet streak from her withered claws. You feel like you're being torn apart before you die, most wretchedly.  ***DEAD***
endif

get something you already have
gethandler checks for max count before determinig if item is already being carried or even if it's gettable

pay while coin not in inventory (dropped)

carrying two coins = you dropped the coin
drop coins = you're not carrying any coins
the following items are here: coin -- even if have 2+

what happens if i drop coin before buying mealbar. then inv will show zero coins, and courtyard look will show 1 coin. when treasurer gives me 5 coins... inv will now show i am carrying SIX coins because there is only one GG\iCoins variable indicating how many exist in the world.

Don't allow dropping coins independently of backpack
or have a GG\iCoinsCarried AND a GG\iCoinsInWorld - ugh.

Drop map says how frustrating but shows marked directions clearly

how to deal with dropping the torch in crypt, or the torch going out.
once crypt lit, it stays lit as long as player is in it, even if torch dropped or extinguished
  need some way to keep GG\fLightSource on while in the crypt and with light permanent on
  #STATE7(?) of the torch is set on entry to crypt. #STATE7 removed onentry to archway
  in TorchHandler, if light turned off, keep it on if state 7.
  similarly, if light goes out, keep it on anyhow with state 7. need to ensure we turn it
   OFF again in onentry to archway (check #torchturns left)
