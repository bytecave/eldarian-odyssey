Eldarian Odyssey is a text adventure game that I started programming in TRS-80 Level II BASIC in 1978. As a novice programmer, I didn't make it very far. So, 40 years later, I decided to finish it. The title and the Green Dragon Inn are direct carryovers from the original as they are about all I could remember!

This game is dedicated to that youthful nerd who never realized people would actually start paying him to do what he loved.

This cross-platform open source project is programmed in PureBasic(tm), by Fantaisie Software. It's a bit of a cross between C and BASIC, coincidentally the two languages I am most proficient in. It was very important to write this game in some form of BASIC, since that's where it started way back in time.
